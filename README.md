# Hotel Recommendation
Hotel Recommendation: A knowledge-based recommender system

This project encompasses a web scrapper (crawl hotel data),  a recommendation engine (generate recommendation), and Streamlit app (user interface) for hotel recommendation.

NB: The hoteldata folder contains the scrapped hotel data files, hotel data visualization notebook, and a spiders folder which contains hotelscrapper.py
