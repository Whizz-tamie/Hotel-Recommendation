Not only in its temperate climate but also it’s exciting and different location.    Nestling at the top of the mountain the  Obudu Mountain Resort  is situated on a plateau at 1576 metres above sea level on the Oshie Ridge of the Sankwala Mountains. The temperate climate offers a total contrast and welcome respite from Africa’s tropical heat. Idyllic tranquillity, beautiful scenery and breathtaking views make it ideal for the lone adventurer, families on reunion, young couple or holiday group.     Obudu Mountain Resort  is in Cross River State situated close to the border of Cameroon and is reached from Lagos by plane.  Obudu Mountain Resort  provides accommodation in the form of African round huts and chalets on stilts maximising the breathtaking views.  Obudu Mountain Resort  also offers self-contained suites varying in size from the 2-bedroomed Governor’s Lodge with its own lounge/dining room and kitchenette to the 20 Mountain Villas, each with three bedrooms, lounge, dining room, kitchenette and balcony.    The food and beverage offering is found in the Terrace Restaurant and Bar with a cosy and relaxing atmosphere made complete by the blazing log fire. National and international cuisine is guaranteed to suit all tastes and the healthy appetites from a day’s nature walk or round of golf.    The Obudu Mountain Resort offers a fully equipped gym, two floodlit tennis courts, a squash court and a natural swimming pool. Keen golfers can show their prowess on the hotel’s 9-hole golf course. The tours to view the magnificent scenery and spectacular birdlife are a must for the visitor to this part of the world and these tours can be taken on foot or on bicycle.    For those who forgot to pack binoculars, the Canopy Walkway which is situated in the trees allows visitors thrilling close-ups of the birds in their natural habitat high above the ground. A major talking point for guests is Africa’s longest cable car system. At 4 kilometres, Obudu Mountain Resort cable car gently transfers guests (and their bags) from the tropical climate at the base of the mountain right to the hotel’s reception area on the mountainside which is often in the clouds and is accompanied by an invigorating drop in temperature.    So, grab your hiking boots, pack your binoculars and come experience this unspoilt part of Africa and sleep easy knowing that all the comfort and top-class service which African Sun is famous for will be provided in your stay. Join us at the Obudu Mountain Resort and enjoy a different but still unforgettable experience.
